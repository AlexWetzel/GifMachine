This is a website that dynamically creates buttons that pull gifs from the Giphy API.

On the top of the web page there are topic buttons. When the user clicks a button, the web page displays 10 gifs related to that topic. Each gif also has a rating below it.

The user can also search for gifs using a form. The topic the user searches for gets added to the topic buttons already on the page.

The gifs displayed on the page can be toggled between still images and animated gifs when the user clicks them.
